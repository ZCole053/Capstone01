          <br> As a parent of a teenagers connecting with them at times has been a challenge. Having this website as a resource
          has been a tremendous asset in us being able to spend time together.- Lilly

          <br> Summer can be a difficult time because the children are consistantly underfoot and they are always saying how
          bored they are. I stumbled upon this website through another parenting forum and it has been the best thing that
          has ever happened to our family.- Chase

        I always felt that my mom was to busy to do anything with me, talking or just plain listening to me, then I logged on to
        here and printed out a schedule with my mom to hang out with each other. After about a month I could see the difference
        it made my mom was constantly listening to me and we were happier. - David
